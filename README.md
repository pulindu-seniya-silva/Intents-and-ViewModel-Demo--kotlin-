This project demonstrates the use of ViewModel and Intents in Android development using Kotlin. I implemented lifecycle-aware UI data handling through ViewModel and showcased both explicit and implicit Intents to navigate between activities and interact with system apps like dialer, SMS, browser, email, and camera. The project is built as part of the Mobile Application Development module and reflects practical skills in Android architecture components and user interaction flows.
